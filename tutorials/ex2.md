# ex2

Note: If you are using MATLAB version R2015a or later, the fminunc() function has been changed in this version. The function works better, but does not give the expected result for Figure 5 in ex2.pdf, and it throws some warning messages (about a local minimum) when you run ex2_reg.m. This is normal, and you should still be able to submit your work to the grader.

Note: If your installation has trouble with the GradObj option, see this thread: <link>

Note: If you are using a linux-derived operating system, you may need to remove the attribute "MarkerFaceColor" from the plot() function call in plotData.m.
